    "\n",
    "- Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.\n",
    "- If the app has a good response from users, we then develop it further.\n",
    "- If the app is profitable after six months, we also build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our end goal is to add the app on both the App Store and Google Play, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. For instance, a profile that might work well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.\n",
    "Let's begin the analysis by getting a sense of the most common genres for each market. For this, we'll build a frequency table for the prime_genre column of the App Store data set, and the Genres and Category columns of the Google Play data set.\n",
    "\n",

    "As seen above the best way to draw assumptions and give recommendation for android apps should be based on the Category and not Genre. As the Genre in the android development is more detailed and doesn't let us pin down one category or area of category to build our app in. Based on the above data we can assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apps associated to Families have a hefty lead when it comes to Free apps catered to English speaking audience. \n",
    "- Games are the second most popular which can be further categorized based on the detailed level analysis through the genre distribution closely followed by Tools. \n",
    "- the next 8 popular types of apps are in close competition to each other including Business, Lifestyle, Sports, Medical and Finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## IOS App Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "While the IOS appstore tells a different story. Based on the distribution of the apps on appstore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Games are the most identified apps in the appstore. \n",
    "- The games take up more than half of the number of apps on the appstore with the filters of being free and English centric being in place. \n",
    "- The next type of app Entertainment and Photo and Video apps are far behind the games but closely following each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "***One important thing to note here is that these numbers just suggest the most number of type of applications in both these stores available with special filters in place. The popularity among users, number of downloads, average rating for such categories is not disclosed thus not telling the complete picture. \n",
    "But at the same time its safe to say that Games being equally popular in both these stores gives some confidence that such applications are high in demand and would recommend our developers to build apps in a similar category.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our aim is to find popular genres, but navigation, social networking or music apps might seem more popular than they really are. The average number of ratings seem to be skewed by very few apps which have hundreds of thousands of user ratings, while the other apps may struggle to get past the 10,000 threshold. We could get a better picture by removing these extremely popular apps for each genre and then rework the averages, but we'll leave this level of detail for later.\n",

    "However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",
    "This idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.\n",
    "Other genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea we described above, but the other genres don't seem too interesting to us:\n",
    "Weather apps — people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require us to connect our apps to non-free APIs.\n",
    "Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",
    "Finance apps — these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge, and we don't want to hire a finance expert just to build an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's analyze the Google Play market a bit.\n",

    "## Most Popular Apps by Genre on Google Play\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Google Play market, we actually have data about the number of installs, so we should be able to get a clearer picture about genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough — we can see that most values are open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.):"
